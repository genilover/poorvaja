          <h4>Power Efficient Mini Inverter</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="descrition">
          <p> Inverters are widely used in the domestic as well as industrial environments to serve as second line of source in case of power cut form the electricity utility grids. Inverter is the device that powers the electric appliances in the event of the power failure. Inverter as the name implies first converts AC to DC for charging the battery and then inverts DC to AC for powering the electric gadgets.
            So here is the power efficient inverter which is small in size and which can give output voltage of 220v-230 /150w. this power efficient mini inverter can be used to power up devices such as Wifi routers, mobile chargers, Lights etc.</p>

          <h4>Weather Forecasting Using Python</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="descrition">
          <p> User will enter current temperature; humidity and wind, System will take this parameter and will predict weather (rainfall in inches) from previous data in database (dataset). The role of the admin is to add previous weather data in database, so that system will calculate weather (estimated rainfall in inches) based on these data. Weather forecasting system takes parameters such as temperature, humidity, and wind and will forecast weather based on previous record therefore this prediction will prove reliable. This system can be used in Air Traffic, Marine, Agriculture, Forestry, Military, and Navy etc.</p>
